# Footer & Layout Updates

## Summary
Moved the "Connect" section to a dedicated footer to improve page flow and layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Connect Section**
- Removed the large "Connect" grid from the main content area.
- This reduces visual clutter before the footer.

### 2. **Added Footer**
- Created a new `<footer>` component at the bottom of the page.
- **Features**:
  - Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) displayed as circular icon buttons.
  - Hover effects consistent with the rest of the site (glow, scale).
  - Copyright notice and call-to-action text.
  - Separated by a subtle top border.

## Visual Improvements
- ✅ **Better Flow**: The page now ends naturally with a footer rather than a content section.
- ✅ **Standard Convention**: Users expect contact info/socials in the footer.
- ✅ **Clean Design**: The footer uses a centered layout with ample spacing.

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/content/page.tsx`
